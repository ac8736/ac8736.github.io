# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website built with React + TypeScript. I'll be showing projects I've worked on, such as websites and games I've developed. Certain projects, especially my earlier ones, are actively being edited and refactored as I continue to learn new methods and better practices. 

The site is deployed with GitHub Pages: ac8736.github.io
